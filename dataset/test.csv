The non-linear correlation between serum sodium levels and mortality in patients with heart failure is currently controversial, and the relationship between different serum sodium levels and mortality is disputed. The goal of this study is to look into the relationship between serum sodium levels and all-cause mortality in people with CHF after controlling for other factors.","The prerequisites for participation were as follows: (1) Patients with the ICD-9 disease codes 4280-4289 and 39,891 (CHF patients); (2) Patients with a first admission and those with a first admission to the ICU. The following restrictions were in place: Patients with the following characteristics are excluded: (1) those under the age of 18; (2) those with an ICU stay of fewer than 24 h; (3) those with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome; (4) those with Dbsource = metavision; and (5) those with missing baseline serum sodium values at ICU admission."
2,10.3389/fcvm.2022.999391,A retrospective cohort study on the association between early coagulation disorder and short-term all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with congestive heart failure,"Coagulation disorder in congestive heart failure (CHF) has been well-documented. The prognostic value of a composite coagulation disorder score, which combines the absolute platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), has not been assessed in CHF. The present study endeavored to explore the association between the coagulation disorder score and adverse outcomes of critically ill patients with CHF.","Adult patients aged over 18 years old with a diagnosis of CHF (ICD-9 code: 428.0) were selected. Patients not admitted to the ICU and those with an ICU stay of <24 h were excluded. For patients with multiple ICU admissions, only the first was considered. And these patients with missing interest variables (platelet count, INR, APTT) within 24 h after ICU admission were also excluded. Besides, some organ donors may die earlier than the time of admission, resulting in a calculated survival time of <0, and these patients were also excluded."

13,10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.11.009,Early Postoperative Acetaminophen Administration and Severe Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery,Oxidative stress may contribute to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. Acetaminophen can be considered an antioxidant because it inhibits hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. We hypothesized that perioperative acetaminophen administration is associated with reduced AKI after cardiac surgery.,"Selected patients were aged at least 18 years and had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, valve replacement or repair, or combined CABG and valvular procedures. The exclusion criteria were (1) failure to determine postoperative AKI status and (2) missing medication information.

20,10.21037/apm-21-1713,The impact of transthoracic echocardiography on the short-term prognosis of elderly patients in the intensive care unit: a retrospective analysis based on the MIMIC-III database,"Elderly patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often suffer from cardiac function impairment. Real-time monitoring of cardiac function and structural changes has important clinical significance. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a convenient, intuitive, and non-invasive real-time examination of the heart, and it has been widely used for intensive care patients. This study aims to analyze the impact of TTE on the prognosis of elderly patients in ICU.","The subjects of this study are elderly patients admitted to the ICU.

The diagnosis of sepsis was based on the definition of sepsis 3.0, which includes patients with documented or suspected infection and SOFA score ≥ 2 points. Infection was identified with microbiological culture results. Sepsis-associated delirium in our study was defined as sepsis patients with a positive assessment of CAM-ICU and delirium assessment during their stay in ICUs."
24,10.1155/2022/2520695,The Positive and Negative Effects of Calcium Supplementation on Mortality in Septic ICU Patients Depend on Disease Severity: A Retrospective Study from the MIMIC-III,Calcium administration in septic patients with hypocalcemia is a controversial issue. The present study preliminarily investigated the effects of calcium supplementation on the length of hospitalization and mortality in septic ICU patients with different severities of hypocalcemia and disease.,"Te explicit sepsis codes were introduced at the BIDMC in 2004, and the group of admissions between 2008 and 2012 was easily identifiable in the database. Therefore, only ICU admissions from 2008 to 2012 were enrolled in the present study. The admissions included nonadult patients, patients with secondary (or greater) admissions (to avoid repeated measures),  patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery (their postoperative physiological derangements did not translate to the same mortality risk as to the other ICU patients), patients with suspected infections that lasted longer than 24 hours before and after ICU admission (we focused on the majority of patients who were admitted to the ICU with sepsis to ensure independence between data points because the MIMIC-III only contained ICU data), and patients with SOFA scores lower than 2 and were considered noninfectious; patients with missing data were excluded."

Improved understanding of disease states, progression, severity, and clinical markers has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce cost.","Patients that are diagnosed with sepsis when they had both suspicion of infection, defined as the presence of the prescription of antibiotics and sampling of bodily fluids for microbiological culture, and the evidence of organ dysfunction, defined as the total SOFA score higher than 2, within the time window of 48 hours before and up to 24 hours after onset of infection. As recommended by the Sepsis-3 criteria, the time of the onset is defined as the earliest event of the following two conditions: i) if the antibiotic was given first, the microbiological sample must have been collected within 24 hours; ii) if the microbiological sampling occurred first, the antibiotic must have been administered within 72 hours. Finally, sepsis patients whose age was less than 18 years old at the time of ICU admission, whose mortality was not documented, and withdrawal of treatment (vasopressors) were excluded from our cohort."

Since very few end?to? end pipelines are publicly available, fair comparisons between methodologies are difficult if not impossible. Progress is further limited by discrepancies in the reconstruction of sepsis onset time.","We excluded all patients recorded under the CareVue system, which was known to be in operation only until 2008. Only those patients recorded under the MetaVision system is retained. Only one hospital visit was retained per patient. We excluded patients who were prescribed antibiotics before their entry to ICU. Patients attending the cardiothoracic surgical ICU were excluded since their requirements for organ support are likely to produce false positive labels in the sepsis phenotype. Elective surgical patients were excluded as they are often prescribed prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis pre-arrival to the ICU and have, in general, a low risk of developing sepsis in their index ICU admission. We excluded patients whose length of stay in the ICU was shorter than four hours or longer than twenty days, to avoid the development of sepsis prior to ICU admission, or bias from atypical visits. Patients missing all vital sign data were removed since these likely represent cases with data quality issues. Finally, we excluded patients who developed sepsis within four hours following entry to the ICU. "
